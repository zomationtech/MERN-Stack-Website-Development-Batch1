Methods are functions stored as object properties.
JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.








the notion of encapsulation (or OOP Encapsulation) refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data,
 into a single unit.
 const person = {
    firstName: "Hamza",
    lastName: "Ahmed",
    id: 5566,
    fullName : function() {
      return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
  };

  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.fullName();








The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript, where function's prototype property is accessible
 and modifiable and object's prototype property (aka attribute) is not visible.









In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. 
The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created.
